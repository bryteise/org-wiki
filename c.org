* C/C++
** practice of programming
** the C programming language
** data structures
** Thinking in C++
** pre-processor
Get file contents after preprocessor is done

new:
make full/path/to/file.i

old:
make V=1  file/to/foo.o
gives you the full gcc command line from the makefile

then add the -E flag, which instead of a binary, makes it spit out the
content of the .c file after the preprocessor is done....
* CTAGS
** generate ETAGS
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BuildTags
