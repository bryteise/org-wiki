** Building a kernel on arch

** modules
*** compilation
If your kernel source tree is located in, say, your ~/kernel-2.6
directory, the make command required to build your module
(typed in the directory containing the module source and makefile)
would be:
make -C ~/kernel-2.6 M=`pwd` modules

(-C switches directory before starting build process/looking at
makefiles)
(M= is used in the kernel's makefile to specify the directory of
an external module to build)
** ioctl
*** calling from userspace
man 2 ioctl

Usage is ioctl(int file_descriptor, int request_id, ...)
file_descriptor can be return from open() call

Figuring out request_id is from fs/nm/ioctl.h
Need to get which function id is being used by looking at strace
Then match id to function symbol usually in fs/nm/ioctl.c and find the
appropriate way the header generates the id (maybe using _IOW)

rest copied from userspace using copy_from_user function
