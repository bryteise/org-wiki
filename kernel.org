*** calling from userspace
man 2 ioctl

Usage is ioctl(int file_descriptor, int request_id, ...)
file_descriptor can be return from open() call

Figuring out request_id is from fs/nm/ioctl.h
Need to get which function id is being used by looking at strace
Then match id to function symbol usually in fs/nm/ioctl.c and find the
appropriate way the header generates the id (maybe using _IOW)

rest copied from userspace using copy_from_user function
