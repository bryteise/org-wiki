*** compilation
If your kernel source tree is located in, say, your ~/kernel-2.6
directory, the make command required to build your module
(typed in the directory containing the module source and makefile)
would be:
make -C ~/kernel-2.6 M=`pwd` modules

(-C switches directory before starting build process/looking at
makefiles)
(M= is used in the kernel's makefile to specify the directory of
an external module to build)
