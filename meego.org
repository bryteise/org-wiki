** Getting Meego image creator setup
follow instructions here:
http://wiki.meego.com/Image_Creation#Requirements
Using
sudo mic-image-creator --config=meego.ks --format=livecd --cache=mycache
to create the image but having issues with hd running out of space
since it is caching things on the primary hd.  Looking into how to set
that directory in the image creator.
